     * space-group type uniquely but a given space-group type may
     * be described by more than one Hermann-Mauguin symbol. The
     * space-group type is best described using
     * _space_group.IT_number or _space_group.name_Schoenflies. The

     * about the choice of basis for monoclinic and orthorhombic
     * space groups but does not give information about the choice
     * of origin. To define the setting uniquely use
     * _space_group.name_Hall, or list the symmetry operations
     * or generators.
