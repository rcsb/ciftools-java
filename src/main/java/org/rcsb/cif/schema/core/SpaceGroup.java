 * Space-group types are identified by their number as listed in
 * International Tables for Crystallography Volume A, or by their
 * Schoenflies symbol. Specific settings of the space groups can
 * be identified by their Hall symbol, by specifying their
 * symmetry operations or generators, or by giving the
